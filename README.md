# Tetris-cross-platform-using-ncurses
A little project implementing the classic game of Tetris. Inspired by the oneLoneCoder youTube video on the subject.
Developed to pass time in CS class at university, so it had to be portable and it had to run on debian (VM's at uni).
Keep in mind, this project is very old (january 2021), so my coding has evolved since then, but I thought it'd be cool enough to share with the world.

If you're gonna be trying to compile it, remember to add the "-lncurses" library flag.
